## a. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.

```{r}
##Create a new data frame 'A' by removing rows with missing values from 'Pharmaceuticals'
A <- na.omit(Pharmaceuticals)
##Generate a summary of the data in the 'A' data frame
summary(A)

#Set row names of the data frame 'A' to the values in its first column
row.names(A) <- A[,1]

clusplot(Pharma1, fit$cluster, color = TRUE, shade = FALSE, labels = 2, lines = 0)

```

## b. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.

#Among the companies that comprise Cluster 1 are #JNJ, MRK, PFE, and GSK; these companies have the largest market capitalizations and use financing to run their operations efficiently. (lower than 0.47 leverage).

#Due to their lowest asset turnover and beta values, the stocks of Cluster 2 companies, AHM, WPI, and AVE, have the potential to outperform the current market benchmark.

#They are the least capitalized company on the market, have the fastest revenue growth in Cluster 3, and are unable to even raise capital to support their operations. (MRX, CHTT, LVX, ELN). These business stocks' strong returns can be attributed in part to their high beta values.

#ClusterÂ 4: AGN, BAY, RHA Because of their highest expense to earnings ratio, they are the lowest earning. Additionally, their Return on Equity is less than 1, which suggests that it is unlikely that investing in these companies will yield the highest returns.

#The group is composed of #Cluster-5 ABT, SGP, NVS, AZN, BMY, and WYE. They have the lowest rate of sales development, the highest asset turnover, and the highest net profit margin. These businesses are prospering as a result of their growth.

## c. Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters)

#The stocks in Cluster-1 have a mediocre personality; they are neither strong nor have they recently produced noteworthy returns.

#The businesses in Cluster-2 are evenly distributed over the world. Despite their sound technical foundation, the media has largely embraced their concepts.

#Cluster 3-Despite having a high leverage ratio, they are only moderately advised due to the security of their finances.

#Shares in Group-4 The media claims that should be preserved because they will eventually turn into priceless assets.

#Cluster No. 5: It is advised that companies having a high net profit margin stay in the cluster for a long time.

## d. Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

#Cluster 1: A workable strategy (since these are reputable stocks).

#Cluster-2 is a collection of gold miners, despite their low beta, the market is very bullish on them.

#The original configuration, or #Cluster-3 (stocks with solid financial and other fundamentals).

#Cluster-4: The original setup (stocks with solid fundamentals, including financials).

#cluster 5 is the recurring cluster. Adding the stocks to the portfolio is highly recommended because a significant net profit margin indicates that the business is performing well.
